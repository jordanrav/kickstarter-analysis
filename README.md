# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview

performing an analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends on which factors of a kickstarter help a kickstarter succeed 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis
to perform my analysis I recorded multiple kickstarters and then wrote factors about each one (example of factors are, date created, goal amount, category, etc.) then I would take those factors and see which factors lead to the success or failure of a kickstarter. the two charts below are examples of this.
### Challenges
One Challenged I had faced was when making chart 2. chart 2 shows what were the outcomes of play based kickstarters when it comes to the goal amount. none of the play based kickstarters were canceled but my data showed that there were. the problem was I had forgot to make the data show only play based kickstarters so to fix this I made it so it would only count kickstarters that had the sub category "plays"
### Chart 1
this Chart is showing the outcomes of theater based kickstarters based on what month the kickstarter was launched

### Chart 2
this chart is showing the outcomes of play based kickstarters based no what the goal amount of money was for the kickstarter

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
the two outcomes that can be drawn from this chart are 
1. May and June are the two most successful months to launch a theater based kickstarter
2. December is the worst month to launch a theater based kickstarter

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
