# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview

By using kick starter data and the multiple factors that encompass it, this project aims to uncover what trends play a role in the factors leading to the success or failure of a kick starter. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis
To perform my analysis, I recorded multiple kick starters and wrote factors about each one (i.e., example of factors are, date created, goal amount, category, etc.). After, I would take those factors and see which factors lead to the success or failure of a kick starter. The two charts below are examples of this.
### Challenges
One challenge I faced was when making Chart 2. Chart 2 shows what were the outcomes of play-based kick starters when it comes to the goal amount. None of the play-based kick starters were canceled, but my data showed that there were. The issue was I forgot to make the data show only play-based kick starters. To fix this, I made it so it would only count kick starters that had the sub category "plays.‚Äù
### Chart 1

Chart 1 shows the outcomes of theater-based kick starters based on what month the kick starter was launched.
### Chart 2

Chart 2 shows the outcomes of play-based kick starters based on what the goal amount of money was for the kick starter.

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
the two outcomes that can be drawn from this chart are 
1. May and June are the two most successful months to launch a theater based kickstarter
2. December is the worst month to launch a theater based kickstarter

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I can conclude from the Outcomes based on goals that the cheaper the goal is, the more likely that it will be successful.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
one limitation of this data set is that I believe there can be even more factors that can be analyzed. for example, one factor that could be included is how many clicks does a kickstarter have. Another Factor could be how many incentives the kickstarter has. 

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
a table or graph that would be interesting to create is whether or not having a shorter deadline leads to a kickstarter being more likely to be successful.
